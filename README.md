# First Action

## Purpose

In the [Building Blocks: Creating your own GitHub Actions with JavaScript](https://githubuniverse.com/workshops/#building-blocks-58-creating-your-own-github-actions-with-javascript) workshop, we'll make this into a Hello World action. 

A [workflow already exists](https://github.com/universeworkshops/building-blocks-first-action/blob/master/.github/workflows/hello.yml) to run the action.
